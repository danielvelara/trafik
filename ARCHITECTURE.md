# Architecture

## Libraries

- [Ebiten library](https://ebiten.org/)
  - open source game library for the Go programming language. Ebitengine's simple API allows you to quickly and easily develop 2D games that can be deployed across multiple platforms

## ToDo's

- [x] The city's map can be static or automatically generated.
- [x] Cars and semaphore number can be configured on game's start.
- [x] For every car, define a random start and destination point.
- [x] Define a random speed for each car.
- [x] If a car detect another car on his route and it's slower, it must slow down its speed.
- [x] Each car and semaphore behaviour will be implemented as a separated thread.
- [x] Cars and Semaphores threads must use the same map or city layout data structure resource.
- [x] Display finished cars' routes.
- [x] Display each car's speed.
